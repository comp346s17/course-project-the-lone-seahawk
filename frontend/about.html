            <h3><u>Site Description</u></h3>
            <p>This is a responsive photo gallery site. Photographs change sizes as the size of the window is adjusted. All gallery photos are clickable and will open full size photos in new tabs. Navigation bar links to the About page, the Gallery page, and my Instagram page. All photographs are taken by Tianyi Liu as coursework in Intro to Photography at Macalester College.</p>
            
            <h3><u>Design guideline...</u></h3>
            <i>Simplicity</i><br>This is a photo gallery site thus it has no long texts; just the photo titles and the navigation menu.<br></br>

            <i>Navigability</i><br>There's a navigation bar that is always at the top of the site.<br></br>

            <i>Visual Balance</i><br>I used the large white spaces and consistent geometric pattern to achieve symmetry.<br></br>

            <i>Conventionality</i><br>I added functionalities that user would expect such as the site title takes the user back to the main gallery page, photos become opaque when mouse hovers over and the cursor becomes a pointer, and a new tab opens when user clicks a photo showing the full size version of the photo.
            
            <h3><u>What do I like/dislike about the site...</u></h3>
            <p>I like how the site is very simple, yet looks like a professional photographer's gallery. Also, I like how almost all things are clickable. I think it is fun for users to be able to click what they see. On the other hand, I don't like how all the photos are laid out in one page. Ideally, one photo from each series is displayed in the gallery and when user clicks a photo, the site jumps to the page with only photos from that one series.</p>
